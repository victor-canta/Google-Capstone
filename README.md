First, I sourced the data in this project from: https://www.nass.usda.gov/Statistics_by_State/California/Publications/AgComm/index.php

After sourcing the data, I conducted most of the data cleanup using Google Sheets and performed calculations to get an overview of some trends using functions such as "SUMIF", "INDEX(MATCH())", etc.

Next, I generated spreadsheets optimal for Tableau visualizations by filtering the data with SQL. Generating new spreadsheets was also conducted with SQL. In this repository, you can most of the scripts I used to get insights regarding
  trends and patterns.

Finally, I utilized the cleaned and filtered data to create multiple pie charts, bar charts, line charts, and several other visualizations. In order to clearly communicate the most important insights, I summarized them via a dashboard which
can be found here:
